bmm_app
=======
This is a Windows Store App for creating Business Motivation Models (BMM) as described in the [OMG specification](http://www.omg.org/spec/BMM/).
Its goal is to simplify the usage of BMM by minimizing the learning curve for complete beginners while maintaining quality and correctness.
Features so far include:

*  Creation of a diagram by dragging and dropping models onto workspace
*  Associating models through links
*  Versioning through author, date and model status (created, approved, denied, duplicate)
*  Reference field for information source listing
*  Export to image format
*  Guided tour with example
*  Real-time evaluation with warnings overview

The bmm_app was developed in the context of a student research project at the Mannheim University of Applied Science. Visual Studio Express 2013 was used for development.
